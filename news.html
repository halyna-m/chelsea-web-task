                <h2>TUCHEL PRAISES PERFECT START WITH ROOM</h2>
                <p>Thomas Tuchel hailed Chelsea’s ‘perfect’ start to the season after watching his side claim a commanding victory away at
                Arsenal.
                Goals from Romelu Lukaku and Reece James did the damage at the Emirates, with the Blues still yet to concede in our
                opening two Premier League games of the campaign following another successful shutout.

                <h2>TUCHEL'S PRE-DEBUT MESSAGE TO LUKAKU</h2>
                <p>Thomas Tuchel has revealed what he told Romelu Lukaku before handing the striker his first start of his second spell
                with Chelsea.
                Lukaku has been named in Tuchel’s team to face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium and our head coach admits it was an easy
                decision to put our new number nine straight into the starting XI.

                <h2>TUCHEL: THE DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN FOR ACADEMY</h2>
                <p>Thomas Tuchel confirmed yesterday that Trevoh Chalobah will be a part of his plans for the upcoming season, the latest
                in a string of Academy graduates to have made the step up at Chelsea, and the boss has been discussing why he loves to
                work with homegrown players.
                Chalobah’s success has been one of the feel-good stories of the early stages of the 2021/22 campaign.</p>

                <h2>UNDER-18S REPORT: TOTTENHAM 2 CHELSEA 7</h2>
                <p>The goals flowed in north London on Saturday morning as our youngsters smashed seven past Spurs in the Under-18 Premier
                League.
                It was an even opening quarter of an hour at Tottenham’s training centre in Enfield, with Ed Brand’s boys looking to
                build on their promising opening-day victory over West Brom. </p>

                <h2>PULISIC MISSES OUT BUT TRIO COULD ALL FEATURE</h2>
                <p>Thomas Tuchel used his Friday media conference to provide the latest team news ahead of Sunday’s London derby at
                Arsenal…
                Christian Pulisic will miss the game after testing positive for Covid-19 earlier in the week. However, the boss hinted
                that Romelu Lukaku could be in line for his second Chelsea.
